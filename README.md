# How to Get Canva Pro for Free – Available Trials and Discounts
Canva often provides a free 30-day trial of Canva Pro, allowing users to explore all Pro features before committing to a paid subscription. To activate the trial, simply sign up on Canva’s website and select the Pro plan; you’ll receive full access for 30 days, after which you can choose to cancel or continue with a paid subscription. Additionally, educators and students can use Canva for Education, which includes Canva Pro’s tools at no cost. Always check Canva’s website for promotions, as they sometimes offer discounts and free trial extensions.
